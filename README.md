Number Shifting Game
Number shifting game is something I enjoyed playing during my childhood. It is a simple game cheaply manufactured by some plastic toy industry, usually available at railway platform local vendors who sell toys. The game is a simple puzzle which is some kind of challenge to every brain. It is addictive and fun too.

It is a console based game developed in C language.
